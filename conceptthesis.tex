\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Problem background}

Peatlands are formed over time by the formation of layers of dead vegetation, which due to its wet and thus anoxic condition cannot be processed by micro-organisms \citep{clymo1984limits}. A peatland is defined as an area with a peat layer consisting of at least 30\% dead organic material \citep{joosten2002wise}. On all continents around the globe, peat areas can be found \citep{joosten2002wise}. In South-East Asia, mainly in Indonesia, tropical peat forest exist \citep{page2011global}. In Western Europe, peat formation started to form after the last glaciation, approximately 11.000 years BC \citep{brouns2016effects}. Moreover, big spans of peatlands covered by ice can be found in Siberia \citep{frey2005amplified}.

Worldwide, peat has been exploited or used for various purposes. Peatlands are e.g. drained in order to exercise economically viable land use practices such as agriculture and forestry. This happens all over the world. However, Europe has a much longer history of draining peat soils compared to for example Indonesia \citep{joosten2002wise}. A major use for peat is in horticulture industry. Since peat has very suitable characteristics as a plant substrate, large areas in Eastern Europe and Canada are being excavated to obtain the material. In the European Union, about 29 million m 3 of peat per year is used to produce growing media \citep{blievernicht2012youngest}.

% true; per year?

As a result of peat extraction and utilization of peat areas, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are emitted to the atmosphere. It is estimated that one third of the global carbon stock is stored in peat areas \citep{page2011global}. Currently, approximately 2 Gigatons of CO 2 equivalents are being emitted to the atmosphere from peatlands \citep{joosten2009global}. That is 6\% of all global GHG emissions \citep{joosten2012peatlands}.


%\subsubsection{Peat in the Netherlands}

The Netherlands are what we could call a typical 'peat' country. Untill approximately 1200 years ago, more than 40\% of the Dutch surface consisted of peat \citep{vos2015origin, de2008vergeten}. These peat areas came up to several meters above sea level \citep{de2008vergeten}. Currently, only 7\% of the Dutch land surface consist of peat areas \citep{de2004verbreiding}. 

Dutch peatlands have had various uses over time. Before 1500, peat areas were mainly exploited for arable farming \citep{ettema2005boeren}. After 1500, peat areas were found to wet for arable land use. Therefore, windmills were used to drain water away. Since the Dutch peat areas where rather wet, the main land use became livestock farming \citep{brouns2016effects}. Peat was furthermore used as a fuel source \citep{van1996turfwinning}.

% Zeeuw; gouden eeuw door turf verklaart?

Currently, most of the Dutch peatland areas in the Netherlands are drained with pump installations \citep{brouns2016effects}. As a result, Dutch peatlands have subsided upto a couple of meters \citep{de2008vergeten}. GHG emissions from peatland subsidation make up 2.5 \% of the total GHG emissions \citep{van2010emission}. 

The actual cause of emissions of GHG from drained peatlands is the process of mineralisation or peat oxidation. This process occurs when peat is aerated. When oxygen can enter the peat, micro organisms can decompose the organic matter that is stored in the peat through a redox reaction with oxygen \citep{erkens2016double}. The subsidization due to oxidation is what \citet{kuntze1984bewirtschaftung} called the vicious cycle of peatland utilization and is portrayed in Figure \ref{fig:peatlanduti}.

    \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{figures/Kuntze1984} 
    \caption{Vicious cycle of peatland uitilization}
    \label{fig:peatlanduti}
\end{figure}

%\subsubsection{Mitigation measures}

In order to reduce peatland subsidation in the Netherlands, different mitigation measures are possible. All of these measures consist of heightening the water table to a certain degree. Currently, the technology of underwater drainage is proposed as a solution for a large part of Dutch peatlands. With this apparatus, water is provided to the peatlands in the summer, the season in which most oxidation takes place due to dry circumstances \citep{van2011huidige}. Another option is to transform the peatlands to nature conservation areas by rewetting the degraded peatlands. 

Rewetting degraded peatlands and using it for wet agriculture is also an option that is currently thoroughly investatigated \citep{Wichmann20151063}. Wet agriculture is called paludiculture \citep{joosten2002wise}. 

%\subsubsection{Varieties of paludiculture}

Various authors have suggested that only with rewetting peatlands, peat decline can be fully stopped \citep{van2016dalende, wichtmann2016paludiculture}. Paludiculture is the only alternative for production farming instead of livestock farming on drained soils. It is therefore not suprising that awareness among various scholars and policy makers is rising that paludiculture will be a significant part of the future land use on Dutch peatlands \citep{abel2013database, wichtmann2016paludiculture, Wichmann20151063}. 

Different categories of paludiculture are consumption crops, litter, building materials, medicines and biomass for energy \citep{wichtmann2016paludiculture}. A large potential is currently seen in farming peat moss (Spaghnum) for use in horticulture and reed and cattail as building materials \citep{wichtmann2016paludiculture}.


%Peat oxidation is caused by low water level in summers in peat areas. Due to low water levels, peat is confronted with oxygen and thus oxidizes, releasing greenhouse gasses to the atmosphere. 

%Heightening water tables in summer times is a solution to reduce peat oxidation. Because current land use practices are not possible with high water tables, paludicultures are mentioned as an producing alternative. 

%Moreover, with some paludiculture crops, peat can actually be formed back.

% how much can we harvest?

\subsection{Problem statement}
In deep-drained Dutch rural peat areas water levels can become as low as -100 cm in summer. As a result, the peat is aerated and can then oxidize. With the oxidation, greenhouse gasses are emitted to the atmosphere and the soil subsides, causing infrastructural damage. The oxidation can be reduced by fixating the water level to a level constantly above the peat. Such a high water level in peat lands is unsuitable for other agricultural purposes than wet agricultural crops (paludiculture).

Wet agricultural crops such as reed and rice have been farmed for generations. Therefore, extensive knowledge is available on its potential uses and biology. Other paludiculture crops such as peat moss and \textit{Azolla} have only been cultivated on small scale since the '90s. Although its short cultivation, a large set of literature is available on these crops as well.  However, an overview of the abiotic requirements of potential crops for the Netherlands is missing. This thesis will deal with the problem that \textbf{an overview of abiotic requirements of various paludiculture crops compared with the actual Dutch ecological situation is missing}. Note that there are topics that remain challenges for scientists. Examples are the growth efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions of paludiculture crops on previously high intensity dairy farming lands. To overcome these gaps in knowledge, a number of pilot projects are currently running to bridge these gaps.

The second problem that this thesis will deal with is that \textbf{(1) there is currently no overview of spaces that are most threatened by peat oxidation and thus are suitable for paludiculture and (2) there is no insight in what paludiculture management measures are optimal to reduce peat oxidation in the Netherlands}.

Many policy makers have realized that something needs to be done about peat oxidation. However, dealing with peat oxidation in the Netherlands is considered problematic since many stakeholders have different opinions and interests. Because of the complexity of interests, it is hard to outline a coherent spatial plan for all the peat lands in the Netherlands. Therefore, some experts hint towards customized planning on local scale. In these local scale planning approaches, bottlenecks will need to be addressed. This thesis will take the first step, it will deal with the problem that \textbf{insight in potential bottlenecks that can be expected in local spatial planning exercises is currently missing}.


\subsection{Goal definition}
The problem statement comes logically to the goal of this thesis. The goal of this thesis is to give insight in the potential of paludiculture as a sustainable option to minimize peat oxidation in Dutch rural peat areas by (1) estimating the abiotic potential of paludiculture in the Netherlands, (2) providing knowledge on spatial potential of paludiculture as a means to mitigate peat oxidation and (3) identifying bottlenecks that are expected to accompany paludiculture implementation in the Netherlands. 

%The first two parts of the goal will focus on the potential of paludiculture in the Netherlands and localize useful places to implement paludiculture crops. The latter part of the goal will give a first insight in the bottlenecks that need to be taken into account while doing spatial planning in Dutch rural peat areas.

\subsection{Research questions}
The previously defined goal leads to the first research question: \textbf{to what extent are abiotic requirements of three paludiculture species met by Dutch ecological circumstances?} The term abiotic refers to both water quality parameters and the water level.

Secondly, the spatial scale of paludiculture implementation will be researched in research question 2: \textbf{where can paludiculture in the Netherlands be used to reduce peat oxidation? } This will be done by doing a spatial study. 

Third of all, sustainability issues will be researched in research question 3: \textbf{which bottlenecks need to be accounted for when implementing paludiculture in the Netherlands?} Bottlenecks can be characterized by the three elements of sustainability, (1) economic, (2) ecological and (3) social-cultural. 

\section{Scientific Methodology}

\section{Abiotic criteria for paludiculture in the Netherlands}


This chapter addresses the question: "to what extent are abiotic requirements of three paludiculture species met by Dutch ecological circumstances?” As a first step, the concept of paludiculture will be explained and various promising species will be described. Then, abiotic requirements that need to be fulfilled for successful implementation of various paludiculture species will be described. As a last step, the Dutch situation regarding these abiotic requirements will be discussed.


\subsection{Promising species of paludiculture}


\subsubsection{The concept of paludiculture}

Paludiculture stems from the Latin word Palus, which means swamp. The term paludiculture was coined in 2007 and basically describes the productive usage of wetlands while reducing greenhouse gas emissions from peat areas \citep{wichtmann2007paludiculture}. Paludiculture is practiced since a long time, with cultivation of rice being the prime example. It is estimated that rice constitutes of approximately 20\% of the world's calories intake \citep{wichtmann2007paludiculture}. A typical Dutch paludiculture crop is Common Reed, which is a water plant species used for thatching roofs \citep{wichtmann2016paludiculture}. Only recently, \citet{abel2013database} selected a list of 812 water plants that are globally suitable for cultivation. In their research, 184 plants were found suitable for Western Pomaria in Germany. Since the climate in this region is similar to the Dutch climate, 184 plants can be classified suitable to cultivate in the Netherlands. Currently, some paludiculture practices already exist. At least 8 million kilo Common Reed is harvested every year in the Netherlands. Usage is even higher, with at least 20 million kilo a year \citep{wichtmann2016paludiculture}. Also, the island of Terschelling is known to have cranberry plantations. Cattail and peat moss are two other common species in Dutch ecosystems that have been put forward as very promising species to cultivate \citep{abel2013database, van2013werk}. Also, Azolla, which is not native to the Netherlands, is mentioned as a promising species for paludiculture \citep{abel2013database, van2013werk}. These three species will be elaborated on below.

% Which authors suggest cattail and peat moss?
% Which authors mention azolla as promising?

\subsubsection{Typha}

\begin{figure}

    \caption{Cattail, \textit{Typha}}
    \label{fig:cattail}
\end{figure}

% Determine whether to use latin names or English names.

\textit{Typha} or Cattail is a plant genus common in Europe (see Figure \ref{fig:cattail}). Two prominent species of this genus are \textit{Typha latifolia} or cattail and \textit{Typha angustifolia} or narrowleaf cattail. Both species were studied as a potential crop in prior agricultural plots in Germany in 1998 \citep{wild2001cultivation}. Both species were planted and its sprouts multiplied with a factor 7-10 in two months. The \textit{Typha} family is known as a robust plant which can easily tolerate flooding and high nutrient contents \citep{wild2001cultivation}. \citet{heinz2011population} compared both cattail species and found a number of major differences between the species. First of all, cattail produces ten times more offspring in optimal conditions suggesting it to be a very pioneering plant. Narrowleaf cattail is more adapted to a competitive strategy, the species has for instance a higher salt-tolerance \citep{heinz2011population}. A study by \citet{grace1982niche} showed that narrowleaf cattail can grow better in deeper water than common cattail due to its greater leaf surface area.

Experiments with cattail are taking place in Germany since the '00s, but have only recently started in the Netherlands. In Zegveld, a pilot of 2 hectares with Common Cattail started. In 'Het Butenfjild', another pilot project was started. Although usage of cattail is currently limited, it was used in the past in the Netherlands. \citet{morton1975cattails} notes that it was used to stuff chairs and make winter protection for crops. Although cattail is hardly used nowadays, interest in cattail as a paludiculture crop is growing. Various authors have suggested cattail as a promising species \citep{morton1975cattails, heinz2011population}. They mention cattail promising, not only for its robustness, but also for its potential uses. 

Cattail has many purposes, which are listed in Table \ref{tab:typha}. The most promising usage is as isolation material. Due to its fire-resistant properties, it is a fire-proof alternative for isolation. It can be made into isolation boards or as a wall-filler. The final products are cheaper compared to current alternatives. Moreover, the product fits well in the current trend of a bio-based economy.

\subsubsection{Sphagnum}

    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{figures/peatmosssmall} 
    \caption{Peat moss, \textit{Sphagnum}}
    \label{fig:peatmoss}
\end{figure}

Another plant that is put forward as promising is \textit{Sphagnum} or peat moss (see Figure \ref{fig:peatmoss}). Peat moss is a native species to the Netherlands that once dominated high peat bogs in the Netherlands. The water supply in its natural condition comes solely from rain water. Experiments with peat moss started already in the 2001 in Germany \citep{gaudig2014sphagnum}. In 2013, a pilot project was started in 'Het Ilperveld', near Amsterdam \citep{van2013werk}. 

% Name cattail species that is studied in Zegveld, and use it as a reference.

Cultivation of peat moss is interesting since it is seen as a sustainable alternative to harvested peat for horticulture substrates. Currently, the best substrate for horticulture industry is still peat harvested from bogs. Every year, around 20 million m\textsuperscript{3} of peat is harvested in Europe to supply peat for horticulture \citep{altmann2008socio}. The highest quality is so-called white peat which has formed from sphagnum mosses over the last 3000 years \citep{gaudig2014sphagnum}. Peat moss farming is a good alternative to obtain substrates for horticulture. Using biomass from peat moss farming in horticulture works equally well or better than standard peat-based media. That is not surprising, since both alternatives have similar physiological qualities \citep{gaudig2014sphagnum}. 

According to \citet{gaudig2014sphagnum} and \citet{wichtmann2016paludiculture}, \textit{Sphagnum palustre} is one of the most promising species of the Sphagnum family since it is highly productive. The authors furthermore mention that peat moss farming is already economically profitable. That is mostly because selling peat moss in niche markets results in high revenues. However, peat moss farming cannot yet compete with cheaply extracted white peat \citep{gaudig2014sphagnum}.

\subsubsection{Azolla}

    \end{subfigure}	
    \caption{ \textit{Azolla} \citep{wagner1997azolla}}
    \label{fig:azolla}
\end{figure}

Another species that is put forward as interesting is \textit{Azolla}, a fast growing surface water plant very rich in proteins. The plant forms a symbiosis with \textit{Anabaena azollae}, a bacteria that fixes nitrogen from the air \citep{wagner1997azolla}. \textit{Azolla} is therefore never limited by nitrogen. 

\textit{Azolla} is not native in The Netherlands, but currently widely common in Dutch waters. \textit{Azolla} can be harvested for various purposes. Since a long time, \textit{Azolla} is used in Asian countries as green manure in rice paddies \citep{wagner1997azolla}. A promising use for the Netherlands is therefore also manure. \textit{Azolla} is essentially a solution to the diminishing global phosphorous reservoirs. That is, phosphorus harvest is limited since its reservoirs are shrinking and it is spooled out to the sea. Taking up the phosphorous can thus help. Other potential purposes are mentioned by \citet{wagner1997azolla} and listed in Table \ref{tab:azolla}.

\begin{table}

\subsection{Abiotic requirements of  implementing paludiculture in the Netherlands}

Paludiculture crops can not just be implemented at any place. The abiotic requirements of three promising paludiculture crops will be explained in this chapter. These three crops are big cattail, peat moss and \textit{Azolla}. In Table \ref{tab:phy}, a summary of the abiotic requirements of the three discussed species can be found. 

\begin{table}[htbp]

\begin{tabular}{|r|l|l|l|l|}
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{|l|}{} & \textbf{Factor} & \textbf{Cattail} & \textbf{Peat moss} & \textbf{Azolla} \\ \hline

2 & \textit{P presence} & May be high & May be high, if subconditions are met & Must be high \\ \hline

\end{tabular}
\end{flushleft}
\label{tab:phy}
\end{table}



\subsubsection{Cattail}


 %\citet{morton1975cattails} notes that seedlings of Common Cattail will die out if the water level is maintained at 45 cm from spring to midsummer. 

Cattail species are robust plants, but have some requirements for growing. Mature plants of Common Cattail will be killed by water depths of 63.5 cm. Narrowleaf cattail can survive in water depths up to 1.2 meters \citep{morton1975cattails}. \citet{dubbe1988production} also note that Cattail species can deal with water depths upto 50 and 115 cm above the ground. However, another study showed that the optimal water depth of Typha Latifolia is 22 cm above the ground \citep{grace1989effects}.

\citet{ciria2005Typha} studied the potential of common cattail in waste water treatment. The authors found that common cattail did not have a problem with high concentrations of nitrogen (52 mg per liter) and phosphorous (23 mg per liter). Also, \citet{newman1996effects} found that adding 0.05 millilgram per liter P or 0.1 milligram per liter N was fine for cattail (Latifolia) growth.

Minimum concentrations of nutrients were not found for cattail, but it can be predicted that optimal balance of nutrients would result in higher production of cattail stands.

Common cattail grows well under acidic conditions ranging from a pH 5 to 7, but encounters problems if pH goes towards 3.5 \citep{brix2002typha}. Narrowleaf cattail seems to be able to deal with more extreme situations such as alkaline and saline situations. A pH of 9 can still be fine for Narrowleaf cattail.

%Evapotranspiration can be between 105-150 cm per year, as reported in Poland \citep{dubbe1988production}.




\subsubsection{Peat Moss}

In contrary to cattail, peat moss is a vulnerable species. Physical conditions should be within a delicate range. Peat moss grows best with the water level just below surface. -10 to 0 cm is perfect. However, as \citet{gaudig2014sphagnum} mention, it is also possible to grow peat moss on floating mats on the water. \citet{fritz2014paludicultuur} note that to optimize peat moss growth, the water table should be kept constant at 2-5 cm below ground level. 

\citet{Temmink2017196} show that peat moss grows well under high N input as long as pH is low enough and P and K inputs are high enough. N input was noted as \~ 30 kg per hectare per year and P was noted as between 1 and 3 kg per hectare per year. The authors furthermore note that high nutrients can cause competitor vascular plant weeds such as \textit{Juncus effusus} or algae to grow. However, in this study, these plants were removed, which proved useful for the peat moss to grow. \citep{wichtmann2016paludiculture} note that peat moss grows only with low nutrient contents, that is a situation that is typically present in natural bog ecosystems.


\citet{Temmink2017196} note that pH should be kept low, which can be done by making sure bicarbonate concentrations in waters are low enough. In the experiment, ditch water pH concentrations were between 4.8 and 6.0. Also, in other studies it is mentioned that peat moss grows best in acidic conditions \citep{wichtmann2016paludiculture}. Also, \citet{gaudig2005growing} found that peat moss performed significantly better at a pH of 3.2 compared to 4.5 and 8.0. 

\citet{fritz2014paludicultuur} note that it would be better to remove the top layer of a previously used agricultural peatland, so the mineral conditions are better accustomed to peat moss growth. That this procedure is ideal for peat moss growth was also mentioned by \citet{Temmink2017196}.

%What is the precise perfect stoichiometry?
\subsubsection{Azolla}

\textit{Azolla} is a water plant that needs full water cover. It can only survive in dry fields for a few days \citep{wagner1997azolla}. The optimal water depth is 5 cm, although it will survive deeper depths \citep{wagner1997azolla}. \citet{sabetraftar2013review} revealed that Azolla plants can only grow when it is floating on water. They furthermore say that Azolla plants can dry out if humidity is below 60\% but that Azolla can grow well between 55 and 83 \% humidity.  Waves and winds could be a cause for death of Azolla, since it would break the fronds (leaves). Cattail is noted as a protector of Azolla for wind and waves \citep{sabetraftar2013review}.  

\citet{lumpkin1980azolla} note that the most common nutrient limiting Azolla growth is Phosporous. The authors note that in Denmark, Azolla was found to thrive with a P concentration of 1.1 mg P/liter. Also, Iron (Fe) can become limiting, but in general 1 ppm iron is  sufficient for Azolla growth. However, the authors note that iron deficiency might stem from a high pH, that is because iron can then be precipitated. They acknowledge, that the more P is put into the water, the more Nitrogen can be fixated. \citet{sabetraftar2013review} note that Azolla is known to not be affected with high N presence. They note that in laboratory experiments, P concentrations of 0.06 ppm  is sufficient. But from the field, they note P requirements of 0.3 - 1 ppm. Salt concentrations between 160-380 mg/l are still okay for Azolla plants \citep{lumpkin1980azolla}. However, it was studied that high salinity can inhibit growth \citep{sabetraftar2013review, lumpkin1980azolla}. 

The optimum pH range is from 4.0 - 4.5, but Azolla can also survive in water with a pH from 3.5 - 10.0. However, vulnerability to pH is much affected by other factors. For instance, with high light intensity, optimal pH is 9-10 but with low light intensity, optimum pH is 6.0 at a temperature of 20 degrees \citep{wagner1997azolla}. Optimal pH levels according to \citet{lumpkin1980azolla} are in a range from 4.5 - 7.0. The growth rate of Azolla declines when the water becomes more saline. \citet{sabetraftar2013review} note that, in general, a pH between 4.5 and 7.5 is sufficient.


%According to Tim Pelsma, a researcher at Waternet Amsterdam, Azolla plants need a lot of phosphorous, more than can be provided by Dutch water systems. Therefore, extra P fertilization is necessary for Azolla growth (interview...).


%However, high  nitrogen content in water can affect Azolla growth.

\subsection{Dutch system regarding physical characteristics}

\citet{van2010nutrienten} studied the current status of nutrients in Dutch fresh waters. They calculate an average N concentration of 3.56 milligram per liter and average P concentration of 0.52 milligram per liter. 

Both cattail species have no problems dealing with these concentrations. Peat mosses however, tend to have more problems with high nutrient rates, especially when the balance between elements is not optimal. Therefore, \citet{harpenslager2015rewetting} propose to take the top soil layer away before starting peat moss farming. Another option is to start peat moss farming after harvesting the nutrients away with e.g. cattail or \textit{Azolla} farming.

\citet{smolders2013waterkwaliteit} note that in 4 locations in the Netherlands, P concentrations were measured in peaty areas in 'Wormerveld' and 'Jisperveld'. P concentrations in the upper 50 cm soil layer were found between 1500 and 2500 kg per hectare. However, after rewetting these areas, P will partly spool out to the deeper soil layers and partly come into the surface water.

% \subsection{Paludiculture as a means to minimize peat oxidation in the Netherlands}


%\section{Places in the Netherlands where paludiculture can be used best to reduce peat oxidation}

%In this section, I will give insight in what areas are most important to introduce other land use to limit peat oxidation. I will do this by comparing height data of the Netherlands as an indication for vulnerability to peat oxidation. First, I will collect 2 height maps of the Netherlands, clip them for all Dutch peat areas and then give a map with Dutch areas that are vulnerable for peat oxidation.

%For this section, I try to constitute a map of the Netherlands which can display the vulnerability of sites for peat oxidation. This may help identifying in what areas it is most sustainable to implement wet crops. A study like this has been done before for a part of the Netherlands. There, they used simple factors for peat oxidation as result of certain soil types and water levels. Because water levels can be adjusted based on people's decisions, I decided to only focus on soil types as a factor influencing peat oxidation. 

%Basically, peat is the substance that can oxidize. However, there are different kinds of peat, each having a different kind of oxidation potential. Also, sometimes, peat layers are mingled with layers of clay or sand. The more the peat is mixed with other soil types, the less will be oxidized. 



\section{Paludiculture and peat conservation}
% In dit hoofdstuk ga ik in op aspecten die handelen met veen oxidatie. eerst kijk ik naar (1) wat is veen oxidatie, hoe gebeurt het, welke eenheden worden gehanteerd, (2) hoe kan water ophoging en paludicultuur volgens de literatuurl veen oxidatie verminderen, (3) welke veentypes zijn meer/minder kwetsbaar voor veenoxidatie en waar in Nederland kunnen we deze gronden vinden? (4) waar worden de dikste veenpakketten in Nederland gevonden en waar kunnen we dus verwachten dat het meeste veen zal oxideren in de toekomst als we doorgaan met ontwateren? (5) vervolgens kijken we naar wat de invloed is van water management strategiien op veen oxidatie in gebieden. Dit is meer een theoretische exercitie met veel aannames omdat er nog niet zo veel onderzoek naar gedaan is. (6)  Als laatste kijken we dan naar natuurgebieden die in het veen liggen. Door wegzijging naar omliggende gebieden worden natuurgebieden vaak te droog. Hoe werkt dit en is het nuttig om om deze natuurgebieden heen paludicultuur plantages aan te leggen? Waar in Nederland is dit het geval?  

In this section, I research the potential of paludiculture to reduce peat mineralization in the Netherlands.

Not all peat areas are the same. Peat areas can differ in composition. For example, in some areas pure peat layers of a few meters exist whereas in other areas, on top or below the peat, mineral layers can be found. Through a different organic matter content in different peat compositions, the potential of the peat to mineralize and thus emit greenhouse gas emissions is also different. For the Netherlands, I mapped areas with different mineralization potentials.

A second and third analysis focuses on the water management in the Netherlands. That is, water levels in the Netherlands are regulated per catchment area. If we take the current catchment system into account, we could use a whole catchment for paludiculture crops. If the goal is to reduce GHG emissions, it is most optimal to use catchments with the most of its area covered by peat. The second analysis will focus on that.

The third analysis will subsequently look into using parts of catchments for paludiculture. If we want to reduce GHG emissions, again the most optimal thing to do is to use the peaty part of a catchment for paludiculture. Of course, these peaty parts must lie lower than the non peaty parts, otherwise, the part of the catchment cannot be used. Therefore, the third analysis will look in a number of catchments and check the height difference between the peaty and the non peaty part of the catchment.

Furthermore, this chapter provides insight in the research that has been done about reduction of GHG emissions by paludiculture implementation.

\subsubsection{Carbon balance in natural peat ecosystems}

Natural peat ecosystems are characterized as swampy environments. Water levels generally are a few centimeters below ground level \citep{wichtmann2016paludiculture}

% Is it relevant? In fen peatlands, water is provided by the groundwater, whereas in bog peatlands, water is provided by rain. 

Natural peatlands are in general carbon sinks. More carbon is taken up than is emitted. Uptake of carbon takes place when plants photosynthesize carbon from the atmosphere into their stems, roots and leaves. When the plants die, some organic matter cannot decompose due to anaerobic conditions. With these layers of dead plant material, peat layers are slowly formed. Although peatlands are carbon sinks, some carbon is emitted in the form of methane (CH\sous{4}). That decomposition rates are slower than uptake rates, can be accounted for by 'slow rates of decomposition associated with cool temperatures, anoxic  conditions,  functionally  limited  decomposer  communities,  and  litter  and  organic  matter  substrates  that are naturally slow to decompose' \citep{moore2007litter}.

In other words, if peatlands are in anaerobic conditions, they can be carbon sinks. However, when peatlands are drained and thus aerated, organic matter can decompose. That process of decomposition by micro organisms under aerobic conditions is called \textit{peat oxidation} \citep{erkens2016double}.

\citet{smolders2013waterkwaliteit} note that peat oxidation is actually a redox reaction. The organic material functions as a energy giver (reductor) and if an oxidator is present, the organic material can be 'reduced'. Since oxygen is a very strong oxidator, if it is present in the peat, the organic matter will quickly be reduced. If other reductors are available, such as NO3 and CO2.

% First story about natural systems that are sinks
\subsubsection{Drainage in Dutch peatlands \& associated peat oxidation}

In the Netherlands, we have a long history of drainage of peatlands. This chapter provides a short history recap of peatland usage and drainage.

% Is it relevant? The Netherlands are what we could call a typical 'peat' country. Untill approximately 1200 years ago, more than 40\% of the Dutch surface consisted of peat \citep{vos2015origin, de2008vergeten}. These peat areas came up to several meters above sea level \citep{de2008vergeten}. Currently, only 7\% of the Dutch land surface consist of peat areas \citep{de2004verbreiding}. 

Dutch peatlands have had various uses over time. Before 1500, peat areas were mainly exploited for arable farming \citep{ettema2005boeren}. After 1500, peat areas were found to wet for arable land use. Therefore, windmills were used to drain water away. Since the Dutch peat areas where too wet for crop farming, the main land use became livestock farming \citep{brouns2016effects}. Peat was furthermore used as a fuel source \citep{van1996turfwinning}.

% Zeeuw; gouden eeuw door turf verklaart?

Currently, most of the Dutch peatland areas in the Netherlands are drained with pump installations \citep{brouns2016effects}. As a result, Dutch peatlands have subsided upto a couple of meters \citep{de2008vergeten}.

In the Netherlands, water levels are maintained by the 'waterschappen'. As a rule of thumb, these institutes maintain water levels in peat areas at -40 cm below the soil or lower. In the province of Friesland, water levels are sometimes maintained at -70 or lower. The constantly lowering of the water table has caused major losses of peat through peat oxidation. The average peat decline in the Netherlands was found to be .. cm \citep{erkens2016double}. \citet{erkens2016double} estimate that 19.8 km\sur{3} of peat have already been oxidized by drainage of Dutch peatlands. The authors note that the associated CO\sous{2} respiration is the same as a global CO\sous{2} concentration increase of \~0.39 ppmv. To put that into perspective, according to \citet{quadrelli2007energy} the change in CO\sous{2} concentration from pre-industrial situation to 2004 was 97 ppmv. Peat oxidation in the Netherlands thus can be accounted for by 0.004 \% of global human induced CO\sous{2} emissions.
 
The impact of ground water tables on subsidence and peat oxidation has been well studied. A linear correlation between water level and subsidence was found by \citet{van2010emission}. The researchers studied the effect of ditch water level and lowest ground water level on subsidence rates. They found the following linear relations:

% relation 1: LGW and Subsidence in pure peat
% relation 2: Ditch level and Subsidence in pure peat
% relation 3: LGW and Subsidence in clayi peat
% relation 4: Ditch level and Subsidence in clayi peat

The results can be found in figure \ref{fig:oxrates}. 

%In general, with a higher water table, less peat will oxidize. However, differences in soil affect the oxidation of peat. Peat with clay oxidizes less than pure peat. \citet{van2010emission} quantified the relationship between water table and CO\sous{2} emissions. They found a linear relationship between ditch water level and subsidence and lowest ground water level and subsidence. 



According to a meta analysis by \citet{wichtmann2016paludiculture}, mean annual water level could explain the net GHG balance with a 95 \% confidence interval. Respectively, they found that at an annual mean water level of -50, and 0 cm, about 20 versus 8 ton CO\sous{2} equivalents ha\sur{-1} a\sur{-1} was emitted. % where was the GHG balance measured? in peat lands? What was the meta analysis about?

All in all, it can be stated that the more peat is confronted with oxygen, the more CO\sous{2} is emitted. However, soil characteristics also play a role.

% emissions of CO2
% The authors note that the organic matter density in an average peat area is 103 kg m \sus{-3}.

\subsubsection{Characteristics of soil affect peat oxidation}

\citet{stouthamer2008toelichting} distinguished six reasons for vulnerability of organic matter of peat soils to oxidize: 

\begin{enumerate}
\item{Existence and thickness of mineral layer such as clay or sand}
\item{Depth and thickness of peaty layers in the soil}
\item{The organic content of the peaty layers}
\item{The presence of mineral material below the peaty layer}
\item{Depth of tillage}
\item{Ground water tables}
\end{enumerate}

The last item (ground water table) was already discussed in the previous paragraph. This paragraph will deal with the first four items, which are all characteristics of the soil. 

% add literature data

\subsubsection{Peat oxidation causes subsidence}

Next to greenhouse gas emissions, peat oxidation also causes soil subsidence. \citet{SCHOTHORST1977265} calculated that in the Netherlands, more than 50\% of the soil subsidence is caused by peat oxidation. The other 50\% is caused by compaction and consolidation of the soil.

\subsection{Spatial distribution of oxidation potential of different peat types in the Netherlands}

In 2008, \citet{stouthamer2008toelichting} mapped the oxidation potential of peat soils in the province of Utrecht. They distinguished six reasons for vulnerability of organic matter of peat soils to oxidize. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item{Existence and thickness of mineral layer such as clay or sand}
\item{Depth and thickness of peaty layers in the soil}
\item{The organic content of the peaty layers}
\item{The presence of mineral material below the peaty layer}
\item{Depth of the tillage}
\item{Ground water tables}
\end{enumerate}

The authors note that the last two factors can be changed by mankind, but the other factors are fixed to the soil present. Based on the first four factors, the authors have made indices for each soil type that represent the oxidation potential of that peat type. In Utrecht, the researchers found 24 peat types. For each of these peat type, they calculated an index. These soil types and corresponding indices can be found in Annex ...

In my thesis, I try to upgrade the work of \citet{stouthamer2008toelichting} to the rest of the Netherlands. In order to do so, I used a map with soil types made by Environmental Research Wageningen \citep{}. In their data set, 56 types of peat can be distinguished (Annex ..). For this thesis, indices for the 32 missing peat types were determined. To be able to do so, we must first understand how the indices are built up.

\subsubsection{Building peat oxidation vulnerability indices}

To calculate the indices \citet{stouthamer2008toelichting}, soil structures of the peat types were analysed and categorized for 3 factors, namely (1) soil type of the layers, (2) depth of the layers, (3) organic matter content in the layers and (4) profile type of the layers.

\subsubsection{something about peat types}

There are many different sorts of peat. In the Netherlands, 56 types of peat can be found. The classification is built up out of 2 components: (1) upper soil type and (2) lower soil type. The first component tells something about the abundance and types of mineral layers in the top soil and the second component tells something about the peat material type and mineral type of the layers below the top soil layer. An illustration can be found in Figure \ref{fig:soilclass} and an overview is given in Table \ref{tab:soilclass}.

\subsubsection{Building peat oxidation index for 'Waardveengronden'}

Since the peat type 'Waardveengronden' does not exist in Utrecht, no index was yet calculated. Therefore, I had to calculate the index from scratch. I did that in the same manner as the authors of the article did. The built up structure of 'Waardveengronden' can be seen in Table \ref{tab:waardveencalc}. Using the methodology of 'citet{stouthamer2008toelichting}, an index value for these soils could be found. An average value of 0.37 was found for 'Waardveengronden'. The procedure to calculate this index can be found in Appendix \ref{app:calcwaardveengrond}

\begin{table}[htbp]
\caption{Build up structure of Waardveengronden}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline

70-120 cm & Reduced peatmosspeat \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\label{tab:waardveencalc}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Interpolating indices}

For a number of peat soil types, indices were not calculated. In order to do so, I used the method of standard deviations to interpolate current indices to other indices. I did this by (1) calculating average values for the main peat types after which (2) I could calculate standard deviations for the sub peat types. As a result, (3) I could add standard deviations of the sub peat types to main peat type averages for the overall peat types that were unknown. As a result, I could calculate indices for .. of the .. peat types. The result can be found in Appendix \ref{app:peatoxindices}.

\subsubsection{Displaying peat oxidation vulnerability in the Netherlands}

Now that I knew the indices of the peat soil types, I could combine the indices with a soil type map of the Netherlands. I decided to make four categories of peat oxidation potential, which are listed in Table \ref{tab:oxpotcategories}.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\caption{Categories of peat oxidation potential}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|r|}
\hline
\textbf{Index value range} & \multicolumn{1}{l|}{\textbf{Category)}} \\ \hline

0.00 - 0.25 & Very Low \\ \hline

\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\label{tab:oxpotcategories}
\end{table}

The produced maps of this exercise can be found in Figures \ref{fig:oxpotfriesland} and \ref{fig:oxpotwestnl}. Insight in the cumulative size of the areas can be found in Table \ref{tab:oxpotareacalcfriesland} and \ref{tab:oxpotareacalcwestnl}.

\subsection{Thickness of peat layers in the Netherlands}

\subsection{Effect of water level and mitigation strategies on peat oxidation}

\subsubsection{Effect of rewetting peatlands on peat oxidation}

\citet{van2013rewetting} studied the effect of rewetting a peatland on net GHG emissions expressed in CO\sous{2} equivalents. The study showed that CO\sous{2} emissions decreased drastically and CH\sous{4} emissions increased. However, the net effect of rewetting the peatland with water table of 4 cm above the ground on emissions of CO\sous{2} equivalents was positive with approximately 1.0 kg m\sur{-2} less CO\sous{2} equivalents. Still, GHG emissions in terms of CO\sous{2} were as high as 2.0 - 3.0 kg m\sur{-2} in the rewetted condition. 

An experiment with top soil removal in the Netherlands, showed a reduction of 99\% in methane emissions when rewetting the peatland \citep{harpenslager2015rewetting}. The results shows the potential of topsoil removal prior to rewetting for reducing GHG emissions. 

\citet{Regina2015} studied the effect of changing water tables (-70 cm to -30 cm) on net GHG emissions in peatlands in Finland. They found a reduction of net emissions with 42\% in an outdoor experiment and 23\% in an indoor experiment.  

\subsubsection{Potential paludiculture crops to conserve peat}

In Germany, carbon balances of establishing peat moss plots were made \citep{gunther2017greenhouse}. The authors found that methane emissions declined significantly over the study time of two years. The production strips of the peat moss  species were found to be net GHG sinks of 5–9 ton ha\sur{-1} a\sur{-1} (in CO\sous{2} equivalents). However, ditches were net carbon sources with release of about 11 ton ha\sur{-1} a\sur{-1} CO\sous{2} equivalents. Still, peat moss farming on bogs were found to be less emitting compared to low-intensity dairy farming. Moreover, the authors note that with peat moss farming, an alternative is provided for mineralisation of pristine peat areas for horticulture substrates.
 
It is known that plants possessing aerenchuma such as Cattail, are methane emitters \citep{wichtmann2016paludiculture}. A study on Cattail (Typha latifolia) showed that the GHG balance after the first year of implementation was already close to climate neutral \citep{guntherghgtypha}. In the study, the authors compared a plot with harvest with a plot without harvest. Harvesting the cattail proved to reduce net GHG emissions slightly. \citet{wichtmann2016paludiculture} note that 'renewed biomass growth after cutting supports net carbon sequestration contributing to a decrease in GHG emissions'. 

Another study implemented Reed Canary Grass into a peat plot. They measured CO\sous{2} and CH\sous{4} in plots with different ground water tables \citep{Karki2014}. The result was that GHG emissions corresponded to 0.08, 0.13, 0.61, 0.68 and 0.98 kg \sur{CO2} equivalents m\sur{-2} at 0, -10, -20,-30 and -40 cm below soil surface.

No studies have analyzed the effect of Azolla farming on the GHG balance. 

\subsection{Water management change scenario's of paludiculture implementation}

% possible way to calculate decrease in peat oxidation if water level in catchment area is heightened: Start with using the soil type data set to only keep peat soils in the raster. Then, Start with determining subsidence rates for the resting raster cells based on current water levels. That can be done by substracting the height with the water level and then using a formula that relates water level with subsidence. we then have a raster with subsidence rates of mm per year. Then if the rates are known, we can set the water table higher. We can again calculate subsidence rates for the peat areas in the catchment. Then we have to raster files with subsidence rates. we substract the raster files and obtain difference in subsidence rates. Following, based on the size of a raster cell, we can calculate the loss of peat per cubic meter per raster cell by multiplying it by the subsidence difference in the cell. At last, we sum up all the raster cell values and we get the decrease in peat oxidation per year.  

It is known that wet crops can be applied in different spatial scales. This has to do with the structure of catchment areas that is common in the Netherlands. Water levels are managed in the Netherlands with larger catchment areas (peilvak "PV") and smaller catchment areas within the 'peilvak' (onderbemalingen "OB" and hoogwatervoorzieningen "HV"). The water level over a catchment area (except for the onderbemaling and the hoogwatervoorziening) is the same, but height difference can exist within a catchment area. Therefore, a first option is to implement wet crops in lower lying areas, since it is easier to flood these areas and moreover, the lower areas are more vulnerable for oxidation. A second option is to use current 'onderbemalingen' for paludiculture crops. .. note that in these areas, it is easier to give input water flows. A third option would be to maintain water levels on higher levels then the surrounding, in 'hoogwatervoorzieningen'. The fourth option would be to flood whole 'peilvak' areas. 

A first step will be to give an indication of carbon balance changes in either these four options. In fact, option 2 to 4 will have easy calculations since the whole area of paludiculture will change its carbon balance equally. However, option 1, using lower areas of the 'peilvak' needs some extra consideration. That is because raising the water table towards the lower areas, will influence peat oxidation in the higher parts as well. In order to give a good estimation of carbon balance changes, it is first good to check average height differences in 'peilvak' areas. A separate section of this chapter will give insight into height differences by taking ten 'peilvak' areas and check for height differences.

Subsequently, a scenario study will give an indication of carbon balance changes after rewetting a 'peilvak' partly. Afterwards, in a final section, insight will be provided about the actual contribution of peat oxidation by 'onderbemalingen', 'hoogwatervoorzieningen' and 'peilvakken'. By extrapolating the found changes in carbon balances, a national indication for carbon changes can be given for each of the (combined) options.

\subsection{Spatial distribution of areas surrounding nature areas in the Netherlands}

\section{Sustainability of paludiculture}

% Water management in The Netherlands is subdivided by 22 "Waterschappen" who all manage a certain piece of the Dutch water system. In the lower part of the Netherlands, water levels are maintained by pumping water away from ditches to reservoirs (boezems). The pumping is done per catchment area, a so-called "peilvak". The Netherlands has more than 10.000 of these catchment areas \citep{nijhuis2013polderkaart}. Sizes of the catchment areas vary from around 100 ha to 10000 ha \citep{Vermaat2010}. 

%Catchment areas are sometimes shared with more farmers, so raising the water table might be problematic if not all farmers start with paludiculture. 

\subsection{Ecological bottlenecks and co-benefits}

\subsubsection{Meadow birds}

Meadow bird populations in the Netherlands are threatened \citep{}. 

The most important boundary conditions for meadow birds are openness of the landscape, a certain water table and moment of grass mowing \citep{teunissen2012op}. 

% what is minimum water table?

\subsubsection{Nature conservation sites}

Various people have mentioned that paludiculture is very useful to implement around nature areas. Many nature areas are currently threatened by droughts because surrounding areas are declining. Paludicultures can deal better with higher water levels than current agriculture practices and thus can prevent water to seep away from nature areas to surrounding areas.

\subsubsection{Water Storage}

All low peat areas in The Netherlands are below sea level and declining further. With climate change, it is predicted that the sea level will rise and extreme weather patterns such as heavy rains will occur more frequently (). Therefore, chances on floods will increase in the future. In order to adapt to these problems, water storage places are important. Currently, it is sometimes hard for water board to decide what to do with excess water. Some paludiculture crops can handle temporary high water levels well \citep{wichtmann2016paludiculture}. Cattail will function fine when the water level is raised with 50 cm for 2 or 3 weeks (). Other species such as peat moss are more vulnerable to fluctuating water levels. 



\subsubsection{New sites for threatened species}

\subsubsection{Nutrient mining}

Dutch water systems are highly polluted with especially phosphorus \citep{}, but also with nitrogen. As explained in sections .. and .., both Azolla and Cattail species are known to be able to thrive well under high phosphorus and nitrogen contents. When harvested, these plants can function as nutrient mining species and thereby clean the water from pollution. 

Moreover, raising the water level when implementing paludiculture, will decrease the mineralization of the peat. In turn, mineralization leads to extra nutrient loads since organic matter is broken down and N and P can leach. Moreover, paludiculture doesn't need input from fertilizer, thus reducing nutrient pollution \citep{wichtmann2016paludiculture}.

\subsubsection{Alternative for fossil fuels}


\subsection{Economic bottlenecks}

\subsubsection{Profits}

The major part of the Dutch peat lands is cultivated with grass. Currently, … \% of the agriculture on peatlands are grasslands. The grass is grown solely to feed cattle, mainly for cows but also for sheep, goats and horses. The majority of the cows - .. \% - live in stables and go out in the summer months to graze. In general, grasslands are mown 5 times a year. An average Dutch cow produces 10.000 liters of milk per year (). These practices can be called intensive farming since production is put as a priority. Only 20 \% of milk production is used for consumption in the Netherlands. The rest is exported to other countries, both as milk as well as cheese. The dairy industry gives … jobs in the Netherlands. In 2015, dairy exports were 7.5 billion euro’s, more than the 6.3 billion euro’s that vegetables gave ()

Various studies are performed that compare the production of paludiculture crops with the dairy industry. Some studies have found that paludiculture produce are currently not competitive with  dairy farming. For example, … and … evaluated whether Common Reed can compete economically with dairy farming. They found that Common Reed is currently less profitable than dairy farming. A study by the …, calculated the expected profits of growing big cattail instead of doing dairy farming. In this study, the authors used a scenario with carbon credits and one scenario without carbon credits. The study showed that cattail farming can give more profits than dairy farming. Still, various people argue that markets for paludiculture products are still small or yet in development. For example, common reed is a product widely used in the Netherlands for thatching. However, only a small proportion ( \%) is produced in The Netherlands. Other countries simply produce reed cheaper. Azolla is mentioned as a promising paludiculture since it has a high production rate and contains a lot of proteins (). However, there is currently no company that uses Azolla. Furthermore, the question is how much paludiculture production the market can handle. At the moment, it is known that many different products can be made from cattail. Therefore, many companies would like to get raw cattail. However, production is almost zero in The Netherlands. If the Dutch landscape can produce tons of cattail, the question is whether the market is still in need of these products. 

\subsubsection{Investments}

Many farmers have invested largely in new stables, equipment or other instruments that help them to do dairy farming. The divestment often lasts at least 25 years, which means that is not easy for a farmer to give up his current practices and start with a new business which also needs large investments. Paludicultures differ for the amount of start capital and investments that are needed. Cattail farming costs .. money to start with and will be won back after … years ().

\subsubsection{Water storage}

\subsubsection{Infrastructure damage}

\subsubsection{Pumping costs and extra water storage costs}

Since paludiculture crops require water levels close to the surface, water levels have to be maintained at such a level. However, in summer months, evaporation occurs, affecting water levels to drop. In natural healthy water systems, this would not be a problem because water is provided enough. However, in current water systems, water needs to be imported in summer months. To prevent water level to drop below -20 cm, a mean annual irrigation of 110 m\sur{3} ha\sur{-1} is needed.  \citep{wichtmann2016paludiculture}. 

\subsection{Social-Cultural bottlenecks}

\subsubsection{Transition to other land use}

The typical Dutch landscape that is known worldwide is a peat meadow inclined by ditches with cows grazing. … Estimate that this image is worth money as an export product. The authors suggest that the typical Dutch landscape is worth ..\% of Dutch GDP. Moreover, many Dutch people find it very important to keep the landscape. The peat meadows seem to be part of people’s national identity. Currently, many action groups are rallying for protection of the peat meadows. An example is .. Moreover, recently, the Dutch ‘verkavelingspatroon’ is proposed as a UNESCO heritage site. 

Implementation of paludiculture crops would mean a change of appearance of the Dutch landscape. In an interview with .., .. explains that it Dutch people do not want to see mono cultures of paludicultures. This is supported by research by .. in which it was found that .. However, many paludicultures do not necessarily completely change the Dutch landscape appearance. For example, common reed is already very common in Dutch landscape. Cattail is a crop that has similarities in appearance with growing maize. A field of azolla or peat moss is green and looks like grassland. In most cases, ditch structures can be kept, so that the cultural heritage of .. will be kept intact. 

Currently, most farmers in peat areas farm cows for dairy products. The farmers often do this already for generations. Most dairy farmers do not see a future where they will farm paludiculture crops instead (). However, in the recent past (50 years ago) it was common for farmers to have a small field of e.g. cattail in the lower areas that could be fed to the cows. That inclines that the idea of combining dairy farming with paludiculture is not so far-fetched. 

Most Dutch areas are currently owned by dairy farmers. However, there was a trend of nature organizations (Staatsbosbeheer and Natuurmonumenten) to buy up land in peat areas. Currently, in the western peat areas, 13000 hectares are owned by nature organizations (Janssen, 2009). Recently, Staatsbosbeheer has mentioned that it will not further decrease the water level in a certain land. That means that the farmers who now lease the land can still do that later or decide not to. It means that current dairy farming practices are not possible anymore, unless they use new technologies (see 1.1.4) or implement other practices such as paludicultures. 

\subsubsection{Maintaining the typical Dutch 'Slagenlandschap'}

To maintain the characteristic landscape of the Dutch peat meadows inclined with ditches, peat subsidence should be stopped. The only way to do so is either nature development or paludiculture \citep{Dosker2017}. The author notes that maintaining high water tables while keeping dairy farming practices will only slow down the peat decline.
